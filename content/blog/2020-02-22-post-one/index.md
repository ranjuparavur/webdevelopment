Here are the stat highlights from the game –

**2** – Number of Australian bowlers to take a Hat-trick in T20Is. Brett Lee took the first ever T20I hat-trick versus Bangladesh in Cape Town at the World T20 in 2007. More than 12 years later Ashton Agar took one here. This was the first hat-trick in T20Is against South Africa.
